When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

You might want to use a remote repository when other people are modifying your files or when you want to modify your own work from another device.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You would want to be in control of what changes were pulled into your local repository, especially if someone else has been working on your code. If you pull changes manually, you can decide when to include changes to your local repository.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

You use clones to copy a repository onto your local machine. Branches can then be made as offshoots of a master or default branch in the local setting. Forking is useful when you want to use someone else's repository and is essentailly a clone that Github hosts for you on their servers.
